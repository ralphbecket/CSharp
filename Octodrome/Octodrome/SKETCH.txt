I want to make this POCO/DB stuff as regular as possible.

Here's my idea.

POCOs will correspond to DB tables.
Each will have a table-unique ID.
Each will have some fields.
Each field will have
- a type (string, bool, date, datetime, int, float, enum, reference);
- backing text value;
- a parser;
- validation rules;
- flags (loaded, edited, conflicted, read-only);

Okay, so let's have a Table class and a Column class.
Tables can have multi-column validators.
Tables can have multiplicity constraints on referencing tables.
